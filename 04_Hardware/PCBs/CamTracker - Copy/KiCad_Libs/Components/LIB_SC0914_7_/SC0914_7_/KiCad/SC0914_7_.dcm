D Microcontrollers connect the world of software to the world of hardware. They allow developers to write software which interacts with the physical world in the same deterministic, cycle-accurate manner as digital logic. They occupy the bottom left corner of the price/performance space, outselling their more powerful brethren by a factor of ten to one. They are the workhorses that power the digital transformation of our world.
